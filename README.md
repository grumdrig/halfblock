Halfblock
=========

Halfblock is a Minecraft-a-like implemented in the browser using
modern, HTML5 technologies: 

- WebGL
- Pointer Lock API
- Web Audio API
- IndexedDB

It's mostly being developed/tested on Google Chrome, and an up-to-date
version of Chrome is probably required to run it. Firefox and possibly
Safari might work also, though there will probably be rot on those
platforms.

The goals of the project are to better understand the above APIs, to
figure ways of doing various features of Minecraft, or of my
imagining, and make something kind of cool. Minecraft is a great
sandbox, but a Minecraft-like codebase is a sandbox sandbox. So each
grain of sand is now a sandbox; you get me?

It is a nongoal to duplicate Minecraft; I'm happy to implement similar
features for the sake of the technical challenge, or implement fresh
ideas. Admittedly, at present, the game looks mostly like little more
than a poor clone.

It is an anti-goal to look at Minecraft's source code; rather I base
my implementations on general research and observing mechanics
in-game. See REFERENCES for links that have helped.

It isn't necessarily a goal to create something fun to play. This is
more of a research and practice project than a game. To the extent it
diverges from MC and becomes something fun and different, that might
become a new goal.
